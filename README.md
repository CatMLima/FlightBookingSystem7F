# Intro

The work in this directory is one of the components to a larger project combining the work of four different teams. My teams' goal was to create a Domestic Flight Booking  system from scratch.

## Research

The process involved researching the Domestic Flights available in Iceland and find out what the existing flight schedule looks like. This part was completed by Þórdís Alda.

## Execution

The next part of the project was designing the database with the appropriate Entity Relations which was done by Cat Lima (CatMLima).

Then the development part began where Cat, Brynjar, and Corey worked together to code the necessary components:

- The Database components which received the information from Controller classes and processed information from the database were coded by CatMLima.

- The Classes and their attribute implementation that matched to the database were created by Corey and Brynjar.
